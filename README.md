# AppPresser i18n Pack

Thanks for helping keep AppPresser accessible to communities around the world!

## How You Can Help

- ✅ **Add a language** – fork this repo (or download the ZIP), copy `en.json`, rename it to your language code (for example `it.json` for Italian) and fill in the translation values.
- 🛠️ **Improve an existing language** – open the JSON file for your language, update any incorrect strings, and save.
- 💬 **Leave any string blank if you are unsure** – the build tools will highlight missing translations so other contributors can help later.

## Submitting Your Changes

1. If you are comfortable with Git, fork the repo, commit your updates, and open a pull request.
2. Prefer a simpler path? Email the updated JSON file (or the new language file) to support@apppresser.com and we will review and merge it for you.

## Tips

- Keep the keys (on the left) exactly as they appear in `en.json`; only change the text on the right-hand side.
- Make sure the file stays valid JSON: wrap text in double quotes and separate entries with commas.
- Add your name (optional) in the PR description or email so we can thank you in the release notes!

We appreciate every contribution—thank you for helping AppPresser speak more languages. 🙌

## Use Your Translation Inside AppPresser

Once your JSON files are ready:

1. Zip only the language files (not the folder) and name the archive `i18n.zip`.
2. In the AppPresser Customizer, open **Settings → Translation Files** and upload `i18n.zip`.
3. Save, refresh the Customizer, and choose your default language or add a language settings page if you want users to select their own language. Note that you may need to [clear your App Preview Cache](https://docs.apppresser.com/article/657-clearing-your-app-preview-cache) in order for the changes to take effect.

Full instructions are available in the AppPresser docs: [Translating Your App](https://docs.apppresser.com/article/383-translations).
